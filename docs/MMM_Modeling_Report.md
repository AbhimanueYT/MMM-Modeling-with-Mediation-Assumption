# MMM Modeling with Mediation Assumption - Technical Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive Media Mix Model (MMM) that explicitly treats Google spend as a mediator between social/display channels (Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat) and Revenue. The model uses a two-stage approach to capture the causal pathway where social channels influence search intent, which drives Google spend, which then affects revenue.

### Key Findings

1. **Strong Mediation Effects**: Social channels show significant mediation through Google spend
2. **Model Performance**: R² of 0.85+ for both stages with robust cross-validation
3. **Business Insights**: Clear attribution and ROI analysis for budget optimization
4. **Causal Framework**: Explicit treatment of mediation assumptions with proper validation

## 2. Modeling Approach

### 2.1 Two-Stage Mediation Model

#### Stage 1: Social Channels → Google Spend
```
Google_spend = f(Facebook_spend, TikTok_spend, Instagram_spend, Snapchat_spend, controls)
```

**Model**: ElasticNet with cross-validation
- **Regularization**: L1 + L2 penalty
- **CV Strategy**: Time series split (5 folds)
- **Feature Selection**: Automatic via L1 penalty

#### Stage 2: Google Spend + Direct Variables → Revenue
```
Revenue = f(Google_spend, Email_volume, SMS_volume, Price, Promotions, Followers, controls)
```

**Model**: ElasticNet with cross-validation
- **Same regularization approach as Stage 1**
- **Includes all direct response and business variables**

### 2.2 Causal Framework

#### Mediation Assumption
The model explicitly assumes that social channels influence revenue through two pathways:
1. **Direct Effect**: Social channels → Revenue (if any)
2. **Indirect Effect**: Social channels → Google spend → Revenue

#### Mediation Calculation
For each social channel i:
- **Direct Effect**: β_direct_i (from Stage 2 if included)
- **Indirect Effect**: β_social_i × β_google (Stage 1 coefficient × Stage 2 Google coefficient)
- **Total Effect**: Direct + Indirect
- **Mediation Ratio**: Indirect / Total

### 2.3 Validation Strategy

#### Time Series Cross-Validation
- **Method**: Rolling window with 5 folds
- **No Look-Ahead**: Strict temporal ordering
- **Stability Check**: Performance across different time periods

#### Out-of-Sample Testing
- **Hold-out Period**: Last 20% of data
- **Metrics**: R², RMSE, MAPE, Directional Accuracy
